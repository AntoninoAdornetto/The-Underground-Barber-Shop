# The Underground Barber Shop 

### Update: 8/28/22 - I am moving the site to a new hosting provider and it is currently down at the moment. Will be back up soon

#### My goal with this project was to build a static site without depending on any frameworks such as Bootstrap, React or Vue. I wanted to keep the site simple but throw my Dad's humor (he calls it magic) within the site to show his character.
