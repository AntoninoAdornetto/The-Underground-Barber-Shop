# The Underground Barber Shop | Also known as "The Armanino Showroom"

## This is a static site that I built for my Fathers Barbershop

### The Site is live and can be viewed here armaninoshowroom.com

#### I built this site to showcase my front end skills I have learned over the months as I am a new, aspiring Front End Web Developer. I did not use any frame works for this project and had the goal to use Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS/SASS in mind. I did use Leaflet for the map but aside from that Library, the site was constructed from scratch.

#### Thank you for checking this out! Any feedback is much appriecaited. The site supports most browsers as it was bundled with Parcel.
