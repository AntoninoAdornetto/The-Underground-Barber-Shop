# The Underground Barber Shop 

## This is a static site that I built for my Fathers Barbershop

### The Site is live and can be viewed here https://armaninoshowroom.com

#### I built this site to showcase my front end skills I have learned over the past few months. I did not use any frame works for this project and had the goal to use Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS/SASS in mind. I did use Leaflet for the map but aside from that Library, the site was constructed from scratch.
